                            agreement
                            you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree

                            reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may
                            submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not
                            waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance,
                            in
                            arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid

                            verifying Customers’ identities; and (iv) determining a Customer’s eligibility and authority
                            to
                            complete Transactions. However, even authorized Transactions may be subject to a Dispute. As
                            such, You accept full liability and financial responsibility for returning any disputed
                            payments
                            to the card issuer. Aisle Planner and the Payment Processor are not responsible for or
                            liable to
                            you for authorized and completed Charges that are later the subject of a Dispute, Refund, or
                            Reversal, are submitted without authorization or in error, or violate any Laws.</p>

                        <p>You are immediately responsible to Aisle Planner Inc., Payment Processing Services and the
                            Payment Method Provider for all Disputes, Refunds, Reversals, Returns, or Fines regardless
                            of
                            the reason or timing. We may decline to act upon a Refund instruction, or delay execution of
                            the
                            instruction, if: (i) it would cause your Merchant &nbsp;Account balance to become negative;
                            (ii)
                            you are the subject of Bankruptcy Proceedings; or (iii) where we otherwise believe that
                            there is
                            a risk that you will not meet your liabilities under this Agreement (including with respect
                            to
                            the Charge that is the subject of the Refund instruction).</p>

                        <p>In many but not all cases, you may have the ability to challenge a Dispute by submitting
                            evidence
                            through Aisle Planner’s self service dispute resolution portal within your Account for
                            payments
                            accepted through WePay. &nbsp;For payments accepted through Stripe, you may have the ability
                            to
                            challenge a Dispute by submitting evidence through an Aisle Planner customer care agent

                                target="_blank">customercare@aisleplanner.com.</a>&nbsp;We may request additional
                            information to provide to Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to assist
                            you in
                            contesting the Dispute, but we cannot and will not guarantee that your challenge will be
                            successful.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>f. Liability. By applying for and agreeing to use our payment processing platform, you
                            willfully
                            and knowingly accept and assume full liability for any and all charges (and associated fees)
                            relating to the processing of payments through the payment processing platform. This
                            includes
                            but is not limited to losses that may occur from fraud, disputes or other that result in a
                            reversal of charge. A Reversal for a Charge may be issued if the Charge is made without the
                            account owner’s authorization or in connection with a Prohibited Business, violates the
                            applicable Payment Method Rules, or for other applicable reasons. If a Reversal is issued,
                            we
                            will provide you Notice and a description of the cause of the Reversal. Aisle Planner and
                            the
                            Payment Processor do not and will not insure you against losses caused by fraud, disputes or
                            other issues that would cause a reversal of charge. In the event of a reversal of charge,
                            you
                            agree to pay, reimburse and/or settle any outstanding money owed to Aisle Planner Inc.
                            and/or
                            the Payment Processor, regardless of circumstance, within 30 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>g. Your Relationship with Your Customers. You may only use the payment processing platform
                            for
                            transactions relating directly to the products or services offered to your customers through
                            Aisle Planner Inc. If it is determined at any time you are using the payment processing
                            system
                            to process payments for products or services of any kind not related to the products and
                            services you publicize and sell through Aisle Planner, we reserve the right to suspend and
                            ultimately terminate the users (subscribers) account.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Aisle Planner provides access to payment processing services to you but we have no way of
                            knowing
                            if any particular purchase, sale, donation, order, or other transaction (each a
                            “Transaction”)
                            is accurate or complete, or typical for your business. You are responsible for knowing
                            whether a
                            Transaction initiated by you or your Customer is erroneous (such as a Customer purchasing
                            one
                            item when they meant to order another) or suspicious (such as unusual or large purchases, or
                            a
                            request for delivery to a foreign country where this typically does not occur). If you are
                            unsure if a Transaction is erroneous or suspicious, you agree to research the Transaction
                            and,
                            if necessary, contact your Customer before fulfilling or completing the Transaction. You are
                            solely responsible for any losses you incur and liable for any costs incurred by Aisle
                            Planner
                            Inc. on your behalf due to erroneous or fraudulent Transactions in connection with your use
                            of
                            the Services.</p>

                        <p>Aisle Planner is not responsible for the products or services you publicize or sell, or that
                            your
                            Customers purchase using the Services. You affirm that you are solely responsible for the
                            nature
                            and quality of the products or services you provide, and for delivery, support, refunds,
                            returns, and for any other ancillary services you provide to your Customers.</p>

                        <p>h. Cardholder Data Security. &nbsp;For the security of Cardholder Data that is collected,
                            transmitted, stored, or processed by Us and Payment Processing Services on Your behalf, you
                            acknowledge and agree that you are prohibited from entering or storing cardholder data into
                            any
                            form or data entry fields in your Account, except into appropriate fields intended solely
                            for
                            that purpose. Appropriate fields are clearly marked with labels such as “card number” and it
                            is
                            not permissible to store cardholder data in fields with labels such as “note.” You assume
                            all
                            responsibility for any cardholder data entered into your Account in violation of this
                            Agreement.
                            “Cardholder Data” is defined as being the cardholder’s bank account or card number, and
                            where a
                            full unmasked card number is present, any of the cardholder name, expiration date, and/or
                            billing address, city and postal code.</p>

                        <p>i. Tracking Payments Collected Outside of Aisle Planner. We allow you to track manual check
                            and
                            cash payments as well as payments received and refunds issued outside of the Payment
                            Processing
                            Services and your Account and apply these payments to your invoices within your Account. We
                            do
                            not warrant that these records are accurate, complete, reliable, current or free of
                            errors.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>j. Suspension and Termination of Payment Processing Services. We reserve the right to
                            &nbsp;suspend access to the &nbsp;Payment Processing Services and your ability to access
                            funds
                            in your Merchant Account, or terminate this Agreement, if (i) we determine in our sole
                            discretion that you are ineligible for the Services because of significant fraud or credit
                            risk,
                            or any other risks associated with your Account; (ii) you use the Services in a prohibited
                            manner or otherwise do not comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement; (iii) any
                            Law,
                            Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer requires us to do so; or (iv) we are
                            otherwise entitled to do so under this Agreement.</p>

                        <p>k. Effects of Termination. Termination does not immediately relieve you of obligations
                            incurred
                            by you under this Agreement. Upon termination, you agree to (i) complete all pending
                            Transactions, (ii) stop accepting new Transactions. Your continued or renewed use of the
                            Services after all pending Transactions have been processed serves to renew your consent to
                            the
                            terms of this Agreement. If you terminate this Agreement, we will pay out any remaining
                            funds
                            owed to you. In addition, upon termination you understand and agree that (i) all licenses
                            granted to you by Aisle Planner and Payment Processing Services under this Agreement will
                            end;
                            (ii) we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to delete all of your information and
                            account
                            data stored on our servers; (iii) we will not be liable to you for compensation,
                            reimbursement,
                            or damages related to your use of the Services, or any termination or suspension of the
                            Services
                            or deletion of your information or account data; and (iv) you are still liable to us for any
                            Fees or fines, or other financial obligation incurred by you or through your use of the
                            Services
                            prior to termination.</p>

                        <p>a. Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE

                            AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN
                            ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE
                            HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN
                            ANY
                            MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK
                            INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF
                            CALIFORNIA.
                            DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT,
                            AND
                            OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an
                            alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by
                            that
                            small claims court's rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is
                            transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own
                            behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for
                            any
                            claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE
                            AS A
                            CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING
                            ANY
                            RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree
                            not
                            to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity,
                            or
                            consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding.
                            This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by
                            any
                            state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is

                            or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case,
                            then
                            either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial
                            Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
                            entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law
                            notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards
                            that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law
                            to
                            the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the
                            use
                            of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed within one (1) year after such
                            claim of
                            action arose or be forever banned.</p>

                        <p>b. Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf
                            of
                            third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding
                            language
                            in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive
                            the
                            termination of your relationship with us.</p>

                            provide

                            periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following notification of any
                            changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes, which will apply

                        <p>a. Entire Agreement and Severability. These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between
                            you
                            and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site, and supersede all prior or
                            contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between
                            you
                            and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to
                            be
                            unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
                            necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
                            enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for
                            herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder</p>

                        <p>b. Force Majeure. We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder
                            where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without
                            limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.</p>

                        <p>c. Assignment. These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable,
                            transferable

                            of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if
                            personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when
                            receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after
                            it
                            is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. Electronic

                        <p>f. No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall not constitute
                            a
                            waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Service.
                            Waiver of
                            compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the
                            future.
                            In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must
                            provide

                            <strong>Consent</strong></h4>

                        <p>In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the
                            time we collect such data, for example marketing and promotional emails. When we process
                            Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and
                            time
                            of collection.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Advertising</strong></h4>

                        <p>We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic
                            information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you
                            agree
                            that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally
                            identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate
                            audience for those advertisements and/or offers. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display
                            their
                            ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage
                            information to
                            Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you
                            personally.
                            Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment,
                            and
                            you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the
                            audience
                            they were trying to reach.<br>
                            &nbsp;<br>
                            We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad
                            network.
                            Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and
                            reporting
                            for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted
                            advertisements
                            to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these
                            advertisements
                            and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their
                            own
                            cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out
                            of
                            web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not
                            Track settings on your browser; please note that we do not control whether or how these
                            third
                            parties comply with Do Not Track requests.<br>
                            &nbsp;</p>

                        <h4><strong>Other Processing Grounds</strong></h4>

                        <p>From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal
                            obligation, if
                            it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is
                            necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.</p>

                        <h4>&nbsp;<br>
                            <strong>Information that’s no longer personally identifiable. </strong></h4>

                        <p>We may anonymize your Personal Data so that you are not individually identified and provide
                            that
                            information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our
                            partners,
                            who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our
                            Services,
                            so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never
                            disclose
                            aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as
                            an
                            individual. For example, we currently use Google Analytics and Intercom to perform and
                            support
                            our marketing and analytics functions as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                            behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy

                            <li>Protect us, our business or our users, for example to enforce our terms of service,

                            <br>
                            Last, we share Personal Data with our affiliates or other members of our corporate family.
                            Furthermore, if we choose to buy or sell assets, user information is typically one of the
                            transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were
                            acquired,
                            or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets
                            that is transferred or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal Data with the
                            party that is acquiring our assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
                            any
                            acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this
                            policy.

                            For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in
                            the
                            GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually
                            identify
                            a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with

                        <p>For individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), our legal

                            context in which we collected or processed it. Generally, however, we will normally only
                            collect
                            and process End User Information where:</p>

                            <li>the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data

                        <p>Aisle Planner uses&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/connect" target="_blank">Stripe
                                Connect</a>&nbsp;as our payment processing platform. Stripe Connect allows third-party
                            platform providers to help you create and administer your Stripe account, and may provide
                            additional services directly to you or your customers. This agreement governs your use of
                            Stripe
                            Connect and describes how a platform provider may help you manage your Stripe account. Any
                            platform provider that uses Stripe to accept payments or manage your Stripe account must
                            inform
                            you that it does so.</p>

                        <h3>Stripe Connected Account Agreement</h3>

                        <p>This Stripe Connected Account Agreement (“Connected Account Agreement”) is an agreement
                            between
                            Stripe and you, being the person or legal entity (including sole proprietors) identified to
                            Stripe as the owner of the Stripe Account that is to be integrated with third-party platform
                            providers that use Stripe Connect (“Connect Platforms”). You expressly agree to the terms
                            and
                            conditions of this Connected Account Agreement, the&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/legal"
                                target="_blank">Stripe Services Agreement</a>, and any updates or modifications to
                            either of
                            those documents made from time to time by Stripe.</p>

                        <p>We use a number of defined terms in this Connected Account Agreement. The products and
                            services
                            that you receive from a Connect Platform, regardless of whether or not fees are charged, are
                            referred to as “Platform Services”. Examples of Platform Services that a Connect Platform
                            may
                            agree to provide are web development or hosting services, customer service, processing of
                            refunds, and the handling of consumer complaints. Your agreement with a Connect Platform for
                            the
                            provision of the Platform Services is “Your Platform Agreement”. Actions submitted by you or
                            on
                            your behalf using Stripe Connect are referred to as “Activity”, and this includes the
                            communication of information about Transactions (including Charges) and Refunds,
                            adjustments,
                            the handling of Disputes (including chargebacks), as well as other features as described in
                            the&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect" target="_blank">Stripe Connect
                                documentation</a>, and “Your Data” refers to data about you, Activity on your Stripe
                            Account, and your Transactions. For other capitalized terms not defined in this Connected
                            Account Agreement (either in-line or by hyperlink), the applicable definitions are set out
                            in
                            the Stripe Services Agreement.</p>

                        <p>You represent to Stripe that all of the information that you provide to us directly or
                            through a
                            Connect Platform is accurate and complete, and that you are authorized to agree to this
                            Connected Account Agreement.</p>

                        <h3>1. Relationship to Other Agreements</h3>

                        <p>Please read this Connected Account Agreement carefully. To the extent that there is a
                            conflict
                            between the Stripe Services Agreement and this Connected Account Agreement related to your
                            use
                            of Stripe Connect, this Connected Account Agreement will prevail.</p>

                        <h3>2. Stripe Connect — Your Connected Account</h3>

                        <p>Stripe Connect allows Connect Platforms to help you use the Services, which may include the
                            ability for you to receive payments for goods and services, or to receive charitable or
                            campaign
                            donations. A Connect Platform may help you to create your Stripe Account, or to integrate
                            your
                            existing Stripe Account with the Connect Platform. A Connect Platform may also conduct
                            Activity
                            on your behalf, provided that it does so in accordance with Your Platform Agreement. You
                            should
                            read Your Platform Agreement carefully in order to understand the nature of the Platform
                            Services and the Activity that a Connect Platform may conduct on your behalf. Stripe is not
                            a
                            Connect Platform, and only provides the Services described in this Connected Account
                            Agreement
                            and the Stripe Services Agreement.</p>

                        <h3>3. Your Obligations</h3>

                        <p>You are solely responsible for, and Stripe disclaims all liability for, the provision of any
                            goods or services sold to your customers or users as part of your use of the Services, and
                            any
                            obligations you may owe to your customers or users. While you may agree to share some
                            liability
                            with a Connect Platform, you are always financially liable to Stripe for Disputes (including
                            chargebacks), Refunds, and any fines that arise from your use of the Services. These
                            obligations
                            are described in more detail in&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/legal#section_c"
                                target="_blank">Section C of the Stripe Services Agreement</a>.</p>

                        <p>Depending on the Connect Platform, you may have access to directly manage your Stripe Account
                            through the Stripe dashboard. If such access is made available to you, you are responsible
                            for
                            all actions taken on your Stripe Account through the Stripe dashboard, including the
                            initiation
                            of Refunds or changing of depository bank information.</p>

                        <p>Depending on your location, a Connect Platform may allow you to receive payment processing
                            proceeds via settlement into a bank account connected to your debit card (“Instant Payout”).
                            Your Connect Platform should let you know if there is a fee associated with your use of
                            Instant
                            Payouts. When Instant Payouts is used, Stripe will attempt to settle payment processing
                            proceeds
                            within minutes of receiving the payout request. Depending on your bank, it may take up to
                            two
                            business days for your payment processing proceeds to settle via Instant Payouts. Stripe and
                            your Connect Platform reserve the right to change or suspend Instant Payouts to you at any
                            time,
                            including (a) due to pending, anticipated, or excessive Disputes, Chargebacks, Refunds, or
                            Reversals; (b) in the event of suspected or actual fraudulent, illegal or other malicious
                            activity; or (c) where we are required by Law or court order.</p>

                        <h3>4. Relationship to Connect Platforms</h3>

                        <p>You understand and agree that Connect Platforms and Stripe may share Your Data in order to
                            facilitate your use of Stripe Connect or the Platform Services. Where Stripe receives Your
                            Data
                            from Connect Platforms, Stripe may use the Data in accordance with the Stripe Services
                            Agreement
                            and the&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>The pricing for your use of the Services with a Connect Platform will depend on your
                            agreement
                            with the Connect Platform. Stripe does not control and is not responsible for Connect
                            Platform
                            fees charged to you, which should be made clear to you in Your Platform Agreement.
                            Stripe’s&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/pricing" target="_blank">standard
                                fees</a>&nbsp;for
                            the Services are posted on our web site, although Stripe may have agreed fees with a Connect
                            Platform that are different from these amounts. Stripe’s fees will either be disclosed to
                            you
                            separately, or will be consolidated with the fees for the Platform Services. Stripe will
                            have
                            the right to deduct from your Stripe Account balance both Stripe’s fees for Services and the
                            Platform Services fees specified to us by the Connect Platform. If your Stripe Account
                            balance
                            becomes negative, you authorize Stripe to debit the amount owed from your Payout Account. If
                            you
                            believe that fees have been incorrectly deducted, or that your Connect Platform has not
                            properly
                            disclosed its fees to you, please&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/contact"

                        <h3>5. Limitations on Stripe’s Liability</h3>

                        <p>Stripe is not responsible for the acts or omissions of any Connect Platform in providing
                            services
                            to you or your customers, or for any non-compliance by a Connect Platform with the terms of
                            Your
                            Platform Agreement. Stripe is also not responsible for your obligations to your customers
                            (including to properly describe and deliver the goods or services being sold to your
                            customers).
                            You are solely responsible for, and Stripe expressly disclaims all liability for, your
                            compliance with applicable laws and obligations related to your provision of the goods or
                            services to your customers, or receipt of charitable donations. This may include providing
                            customer service, notification and handling of refunds or consumer complaints, provision of
                            receipts, registering your legal entity, or other actions not related to the Services. You
                            agree
                            to indemnify Stripe for any losses we incur based on your failure to properly describe or
                            deliver goods or services, or comply with your legal or contractual obligations to your
                            customers.</p>

                        <h3>6. Other General Legal Terms</h3>

                        <p><strong>a. Term, Termination, and the Effects of Termination:</strong>&nbsp;The term of this
                            Connected Account Agreement will begin when you register your Stripe Account with a Connect
                            Platform and will end when terminated by you or by Stripe, as described in this Connected
                            Account Agreement. You may terminate this Connected Account Agreement at any time by
                            providing
                            notice to Stripe and immediately ceasing your use of Stripe Connect. However, if you
                            commence
                            using Stripe Connect again, you are consenting to this Connected Account Agreement. Stripe
                            may
                            terminate this Connected Account Agreement (a) where you are in breach of this Connected
                            Account
                            Agreement and fail to cure the breach upon 30 days’ notice by Stripe (such notice and cure
                            period only being required if curing the breach is feasible); or (b) upon 120 days’ notice
                            for
                            any reason. Stripe may also terminate this Connected Account Agreement immediately if you
                            are
                            the subject of any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition or proceeding,
                            or
                            if Stripe determines that you are engaged in activity that fails to comply with applicable
                            law
                            or causes a significant risk of reputational harm to Stripe.</p>

                        <p>Section 5 and all provisions giving rise to continuing obligations will survive termination
                            of
                            this Connected Account Agreement. As stated above, the Stripe Services Agreement governs
                            your
                            use of Services, so the termination of this Connected Account Agreement will not immediately
                            trigger termination of the Stripe Services Agreement. All obligations in the Stripe Services
                            Agreement will only be terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stripe
                            Services Agreement. Termination of the Stripe Services Agreement will cause this Connected
                            Account Agreement to automatically terminate.</p>

                        <p><strong>b. Governing Law, Disputes, and Interpretation:</strong>&nbsp;The provisions of the
                            applicable Stripe Services Agreement governing applicable law (jurisdiction), location of
                            suits
                            and disputes (venue), and any method for dispute resolution are incorporated into this
                            Connected
                            Account Agreement by reference. Headings are included for convenience only, and should not
                            be
                            considered in interpreting this Connected Account Agreement. No provision of this Connected
                            Account Agreement will be construed against any party on the basis of that party being the
                            drafter. Unless stated otherwise, the word “including” means “including, without
                            limitation.”
                            This Connected Account Agreement does not limit any rights of enforcement that Stripe may
                            have
                            under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws. Stripe’s delay or failure to assert
                            any
                            right or provision under this Connected Account Agreement does not constitute a waiver of
                            such
                            right or provision. No waiver of any term of this Connected Account Agreement will be deemed
                            a
                            further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>

                        <p><strong>c. Stripe Services Agreement:</strong>&nbsp;The Stripe Services Agreement version
                            incorporated into this Connected Account Agreement is the version applicable to your Stripe
                            Account jurisdiction. If the name of your jurisdiction does not appear in the title of the

                        <p><strong>d. Right to Amend:</strong>&nbsp;Stripe may amend this Connected Account Agreement at
                            any
                            time. You will be provided with notice of amendments through email (which may originate from
                            Stripe or from a Connect Platform), the Stripe dashboard, and/or Stripe’s web site. You
                            agree
                            that any changes to this Connected Account Agreement will be binding on you 7 days after the
                            amendment is made by Stripe (or, if a longer period is required by applicable law, such
                            longer
                            period). If you elect to not accept the changes to this Connected Account Agreement, you
                            must
                            (a) provide notice to Stripe and (b) immediately cease using Stripe Connect. Where you do
                            not
                            provide such notice prior to the amendments becoming binding, by continuing to use the
                            Services
                            you agree that you are consenting to any such changes to the Connected Account Agreement.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>e. Assignment:</strong>&nbsp;You may not assign or attempt to assign this Connected
                            Account Agreement without the express consent of Stripe in advance.</p>

                        <p><strong>f. Entire Agreement:</strong>&nbsp;This Connected Account Agreement constitutes the
                            entire agreement between you and Stripe with respect to Stripe Connect. This Agreement sets
                            forth your exclusive remedies with respect to Stripe Connect. If any provision or portion of
                            this Connected Account Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable
                            law,
                            then it will be reformed interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the
                            greatest extent possible, and all remaining provisions will continue in full force and
                            effect.
                        </p>

                        <p>Thank you and welcome to Stripe Connect!</p>
