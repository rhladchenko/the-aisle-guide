						<h2>DMCA Copyright Infringement Policy</h2>
	
						<p>ï»¿Effective date: August 27th, 2017.</p>
						
						<p>In accordance with the DMCA, weâve adopted the policy below toward copyright infringement. We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.</p>
						
						<p>Remember that your use of Aisle Plannerâs Services is at all times subject to the&nbsp;<a href="http://pro.aisleplanner.com/legal">Terms of Service</a>, which incorporates this Copyright Dispute Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the&nbsp;<a href="http://pro.aisleplanner.com/legal">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><em>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements.</em>&nbsp;If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Aisle Plannerâs Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our âDesignated Agent,â whose contact details are listed below):</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>a. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed; b. Identification of works or materials being infringed; c. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Aisle Planner is capable of finding and verifying its existence; d. Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address; e. A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1)(c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and f. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><em>Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent.</em>&nbsp;Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>a. remove or disable access to the infringing material; b. notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and c. terminate such content provider's access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent. If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>a. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider; b. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled; c. A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and d. Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content providerâs address is located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Aisle Planner is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
						
						<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Aisle Planner may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Aisle Planner may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Aisle Planner's discretion.</p>

						<h2>Stripe Connected Account Agreement</h2>
	
						<h3>About Aisle Planner and Stripe Connect</h3>
						
						<p>Last Updated: May 25, 2017.</p>
						
						<p>Aisle Planner uses&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/connect" target="_blank">Stripe Connect</a>&nbsp;as our payment processing platform. Stripe Connect allows third-party platform providers to help you create and administer your Stripe account, and may provide additional services directly to you or your customers. This agreement governs your use of Stripe Connect and describes how a platform provider may help you manage your Stripe account. Any platform provider that uses Stripe to accept payments or manage your Stripe account must inform you that it does so.</p>
						
						<h3>Stripe Connected Account Agreement</h3>
						
						<p>This Stripe Connected Account Agreement (âConnected Account Agreementâ) is an agreement between Stripe and you, being the person or legal entity (including sole proprietors) identified to Stripe as the owner of the Stripe Account that is to be integrated with third-party platform providers that use Stripe Connect (âConnect Platformsâ). You expressly agree to the terms and conditions of this Connected Account Agreement, the&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank">Stripe Services Agreement</a>, and any updates or modifications to either of those documents made from time to time by Stripe.</p>
						
						<p>We use a number of defined terms in this Connected Account Agreement. The products and services that you receive from a Connect Platform, regardless of whether or not fees are charged, are referred to as âPlatform Servicesâ. Examples of Platform Services that a Connect Platform may agree to provide are web development or hosting services, customer service, processing of refunds, and the handling of consumer complaints. Your agreement with a Connect Platform for the provision of the Platform Services is âYour Platform Agreementâ. Actions submitted by you or on your behalf using Stripe Connect are referred to as âActivityâ, and this includes the communication of information about Transactions (including Charges) and Refunds, adjustments, the handling of Disputes (including chargebacks), as well as other features as described in the&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect" target="_blank">Stripe Connect documentation</a>, and âYour Dataâ refers to data about you, Activity on your Stripe Account, and your Transactions. For other capitalized terms not defined in this Connected Account Agreement (either in-line or by hyperlink), the applicable definitions are set out in the Stripe Services Agreement.</p>
						
						<p>You represent to Stripe that all of the information that you provide to us directly or through a Connect Platform is accurate and complete, and that you are authorized to agree to this Connected Account Agreement.</p>
						
						<h3>1. Relationship to Other Agreements</h3>
						
						<p>Please read this Connected Account Agreement carefully. To the extent that there is a conflict between the Stripe Services Agreement and this Connected Account Agreement related to your use of Stripe Connect, this Connected Account Agreement will prevail.</p>
						
						<h3>2. Stripe Connect â Your Connected Account</h3>
						
						<p>Stripe Connect allows Connect Platforms to help you use the Services, which may include the ability for you to receive payments for goods and services, or to receive charitable or campaign donations. A Connect Platform may help you to create your Stripe Account, or to integrate your existing Stripe Account with the Connect Platform. A Connect Platform may also conduct Activity on your behalf, provided that it does so in accordance with Your Platform Agreement. You should read Your Platform Agreement carefully in order to understand the nature of the Platform Services and the Activity that a Connect Platform may conduct on your behalf. Stripe is not a Connect Platform, and only provides the Services described in this Connected Account Agreement and the Stripe Services Agreement.</p>
						
						<h3>3. Your Obligations</h3>
						
						<p>You are solely responsible for, and Stripe disclaims all liability for, the provision of any goods or services sold to your customers or users as part of your use of the Services, and any obligations you may owe to your customers or users. While you may agree to share some liability with a Connect Platform, you are always financially liable to Stripe for Disputes (including chargebacks), Refunds, and any fines that arise from your use of the Services. These obligations are described in more detail in&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/legal#section_c" target="_blank">Section C of the Stripe Services Agreement</a>.</p>
						
						<p>Depending on the Connect Platform, you may have access to directly manage your Stripe Account through the Stripe dashboard. If such access is made available to you, you are responsible for all actions taken on your Stripe Account through the Stripe dashboard, including the initiation of Refunds or changing of depository bank information.</p>
						
						<p>Depending on your location, a Connect Platform may allow you to receive payment processing proceeds via settlement into a bank account connected to your debit card (âInstant Payoutâ). Your Connect Platform should let you know if there is a fee associated with your use of Instant Payouts. When Instant Payouts is used, Stripe will attempt to settle payment processing proceeds within minutes of receiving the payout request. Depending on your bank, it may take up to two business days for your payment processing proceeds to settle via Instant Payouts. Stripe and your Connect Platform reserve the right to change or suspend Instant Payouts to you at any time, including (a) due to pending, anticipated, or excessive Disputes, Chargebacks, Refunds, or Reversals; (b) in the event of suspected or actual fraudulent, illegal or other malicious activity; or (c) where we are required by Law or court order.</p>
						
						<h3>4. Relationship to Connect Platforms</h3>
						
						<p>You understand and agree that Connect Platforms and Stripe may share Your Data in order to facilitate your use of Stripe Connect or the Platform Services. Where Stripe receives Your Data from Connect Platforms, Stripe may use the Data in accordance with the Stripe Services Agreement and the&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
						
						<p>The pricing for your use of the Services with a Connect Platform will depend on your agreement with the Connect Platform. Stripe does not control and is not responsible for Connect Platform fees charged to you, which should be made clear to you in Your Platform Agreement. Stripeâs&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/pricing" target="_blank">standard fees</a>&nbsp;for the Services are posted on our web site, although Stripe may have agreed fees with a Connect Platform that are different from these amounts. Stripeâs fees will either be disclosed to you separately, or will be consolidated with the fees for the Platform Services. Stripe will have the right to deduct from your Stripe Account balance both Stripeâs fees for Services and the Platform Services fees specified to us by the Connect Platform. If your Stripe Account balance becomes negative, you authorize Stripe to debit the amount owed from your Payout Account. If you believe that fees have been incorrectly deducted, or that your Connect Platform has not properly disclosed its fees to you, please&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>
